# 3 - Nested object parsing

For this challenge the requirement was to create a function that you can pass an object, and a key selector into and the function would return the approvate value from the object based on the key

I used C# for this challenge again as it is the language I am most familiar with

The project comes in 2 parts, a project for the 'library' that provides the function (in a class called Parser), and a project for unit tests

The unit tests are all passing, so I consider the requirements satisfied
